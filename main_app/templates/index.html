        <h2>What is a Nuzlocke?</h2>
        <p>
          The Nuzlocke Challenge is essentially a self-imposed ruleset to make the game more challenging. This challenge was named after the user who came up with the idea. The core rules include: When your Pokemon faint, they are to be considered "dead", and can no longer be used. You may only catch the first wild Pokemon you see in each area, if you fail to catch it, you lose your only chance. You must name your Pokemon, as to form stronger emotional bonds with them in the event they may eventually "die."
